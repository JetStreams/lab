This project attempts to create a 3D Model of JetStreams in the atmosphere
=========

Information been Displayed
---------

The model shows the speed of the stream in a certain heigt, which is roughly the the midlle between upper and lower height. 
So it is not the actual form of the wind, but a representation of the speed at a position.
