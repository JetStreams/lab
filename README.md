This project attempts to create a 3D Model of JetStreams in the atmosphere
=========

Information been displayed
---------

The model shows the speed of the stream in a certain height, which is roughly the midlle between upper and lower height. 
So it is not the actual form of the wind, but a representation of the speed at a position.

The [Demo Web Application](http://lab.ma-schroed.eu.cloudbees.net/) is deployed daily.
